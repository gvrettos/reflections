 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git metadata folder is created. This will keep the information of my commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is an intermediate step between the working directory and a commit to the repository. It helps us pick only the files we want to add to a specific commit.
