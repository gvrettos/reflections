How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I know the first version is bug-free. So somewhere between the differences the bug will certainly appear.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I could easily check back and forth the different versions of my program (especially milestones) and maybe copy some repetitive code task or even spot a bug introduced between2 versions more easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: keep instances of code when you need (landmarks), logical separation of tasks completed, better self-organization
Cons: lot of manual work, may lose progress

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
All files may be related, complementary or dependent on each other so they are considered as single unit/module.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
With git log I can check the history of commits. With git log --stat I can an overview of changes between commits. With git diff <first_commit> <second_commit> I can see the exact changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I just make a different commit with my "experiments" and get back to an older commt if a bug was introduced.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Nothing really. I expect furter guidance.
